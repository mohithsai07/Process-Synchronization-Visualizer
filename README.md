Process Synchronization Visualizer
Overview
The Process Synchronization Visualizer is a tool designed to help users understand how multiple processes coordinate to access shared resources without conflicts. It demonstrates various synchronization techniques like mutexes, semaphores, and barriers, ensuring orderly execution and preventing race conditions.

Features
Visual representation of process synchronization
Demonstration of mutex locks, semaphores, and barriers
Simulation of process execution with shared resources
User-friendly interface for better understanding

Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++
Graphics Library (if applicable) for visualization
Multi-threading for process simulation

How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_link>
Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

g++ process_sync.cpp -o process_sync -lpthread
Run the executable:

./process_sync
Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to enhance the visualization, add more synchronization techniques, or optimize performance.
